**[Electron-based](http://electron.atom.io) DASH video player application for PC**

Detailed description about this project will be added later. 
Please go to [demo site](http://pallycon.com/pallycon-test/electron-demo.html) to test installation and demo playback.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
